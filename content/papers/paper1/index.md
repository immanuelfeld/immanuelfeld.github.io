##### Abstract

Climate action requires significant public and private sector investments to achieve meaningful reductions in carbon emissions. This paper documents that austerity, coupled with a lack of (digital) skills in (local) government, may have been a significant barrier to delivering climate action in the form of retrofitting. Decomposing heterogeneity in estimated treatment effects of a large scale energy efficiency program rolled out through a regression discontinuity design in the early 2010s, we find that both the extent of local budget cuts and poor digital connectivity may be responsible for up to 30\% fewer retrofit installations that counterfactually would have taken place.
